# Emojify

This is a personal project from DeepLearning.AI's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/) Course#5: Sequence Models

Building an emojifier that implements a model to find the most appropriate emoji to be used with a sentence. For example, when passing the sentence 'I love you' through the model, we get the output 'I love you ❤️'
